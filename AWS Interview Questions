AWS-focused interview questions and answers tailored for a Java Backend Developer with 3+ years of experience like yourself, based on your resume and skills:


 ðŸ”¹ 1. How have you used AWS in your backend projects?

Answer:
In my projects, Iâ€™ve used AWS services like:

 EC2 for hosting microservices,
 S3 for storing and retrieving files/documents,
 RDS (PostgreSQL) for managed databases,
 CloudWatch for monitoring and logs,
 IAM for managing access control.

I integrated these services into Spring Boot applications using AWS SDK and ensured security best practices with proper IAM roles and environment variable-based credential management.

 ðŸ”¹ 2. What is the difference between EC2 and Lambda? Which one would you choose for your Java microservices?

Answer:

 EC2 is Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) allowing full control over the OS and environment. It's suitable for long-running microservices.
 Lambda is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), suitable for short-lived, event-driven tasks.

For my Java microservices, I prefer EC2 or ECS Fargate due to better cold start performance and easier management of long-running applications.

 ðŸ”¹ 3. How would you deploy a Spring Boot application on AWS?

Answer:
I would:

1. Package the Spring Boot app as a JAR.
2. Create a Docker image and push it to Amazon ECR.
3. Use Amazon ECS (Fargate) or EC2 for container deployment.
4. Store secrets/configs using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.
5. Set up monitoring with CloudWatch Logs.

Optionally, use Elastic Beanstalk for simpler deployments without managing infrastructure.

---

 ðŸ”¹ 4. What AWS services would you use to build a microservices architecture?

Answer:

 API Gateway â€“ expose REST APIs.
 Lambda or ECS â€“ run microservices.
 S3 â€“ store static content/files.
 DynamoDB / RDS â€“ backend databases.
 SNS/SQS/Kafka on MSK â€“ asynchronous communication.
 CloudWatch â€“ monitoring.
 ECR â€“ store Docker images.
 IAM â€“ secure access control.

 ðŸ”¹ 5. How do you handle security and credentials in AWS-integrated Java apps?

Answer:

 Use IAM roles with EC2/ECS to avoid hardcoding credentials.
 Use AWS SDK Default Credential Provider Chain.
 Store sensitive values in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.
 Enable encryption at rest and in-transit (TLS).

---

 ðŸ”¹ 6. What are some common challenges in integrating AWS with Java backend systems?

Answer:

 Handling AWS SDK version compatibility with Java versions (especially Java 17+).
 Managing cold starts with Lambda for Java apps.
 Monitoring and debugging distributed systems using CloudWatch effectively.
 Ensuring secure, environment-specific configurations.
 Efficient cost management when scaling services like EC2, RDS.

---

 ðŸ”¹ 7. What is Amazon RDS and how is it different from deploying a database on EC2?

Answer:

 Amazon RDS is a managed service for databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.). AWS handles backups, patching, scaling, and availability.
 Running a DB on EC2 gives full control but you manage everything manually.

For reliability and ease, I prefer RDS, especially for production systems.

---

 ðŸ”¹ 8. Explain how you monitor your services on AWS.

Answer:
I use:

 CloudWatch Logs for application logs.
 CloudWatch Alarms for CPU, memory, and request metrics.
 X-Ray for tracing service latency.
 Custom metrics from the Spring Boot app using Micrometer + CloudWatch integration.

---

 ðŸ”¹ 9. How do you ensure high availability and fault tolerance in your AWS deployments?

Answer:

 Use Auto Scaling Groups with EC2.
 Deploy in multiple Availability Zones.
 Use Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic.
 Enable Multi-AZ deployments for RDS.
 Use CloudFront + S3 for resilient static content delivery.

---

 ðŸ”¹ 10. Have you used any Infrastructure-as-Code tools to manage AWS resources?

Answer:
Yes. Iâ€™ve worked with:

 Terraform â€“ for provisioning and managing AWS infrastructure.
 Also familiar with AWS CloudFormation.
 I use version control for IaC files and maintain environments like dev/test/prod using workspaces or stacks.
