 ❓ How do you manage tasks when you're working on multiple microservices with different deadlines?

Answer:
I prioritize tasks based on business impact, urgency, and dependencies. 
I break down work into smaller deliverables and keep track using tools like Jira. 
For microservices with tighter deadlines or external dependencies, I focus on early 
planning and proactive communication with stakeholders. I also ensure regular sync-ups 
with the team to avoid bottlenecks and adjust priorities as needed.

---

 ❓ Have you ever disagreed with a senior or team lead on a technical decision? How did you handle it?

Answer:
Yes, I once disagreed with a proposed design involving shared database access 
between microservices, which I felt could cause tight coupling. I respectfully 
shared my concerns with supporting documentation and suggested an event-driven 
approach instead. We discussed it openly in a design review, and though the final 
decision was a middle ground, the team appreciated the constructive input.
I believe in respectful, data-driven discussions.

---

 ❓ Can you describe a time when a production issue occurred? How did you react and resolve it?

Answer:
We once had a production issue where a service stopped processing Kafka messages
due to an unhandled null pointer exception after a deployment. I immediately helped
analyze the logs, identified the root cause, and rolled back the deployment.
We added better null checks, improved logging, and later created a regression 
test to prevent such issues in the future. I also worked with QA and DevOps to
update our monitoring alerts.

---

 ❓ How do you ensure the quality of your code before delivering it for 
review or deployment?

Answer:
I follow clean code principles, proper naming conventions, and SOLID design principles. 
I write unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito, and I ensure high test coverage. 
I also test my microservices in local and staging environments using Postman 
or Swagger. Before delivery, I do self-reviews and leverage SonarQube or static 
analysis tools if available.

---

 ❓ How do you collaborate with QA, DevOps, and other teams in a microservices-based project?

Answer:
I ensure early communication with QA to clarify test scenarios and edge cases. 
I write clear API contracts and share Postman collections or Swagger docs. 
With DevOps, I work on defining deployment pipelines, configuration management, 
and resolving environment issues. I also actively participate in stand-ups 
and cross-functional meetings to ensure alignment.

---

 ❓ How do you prioritize bugs and feature enhancements in a sprint?

Answer:
I prioritize based on business impact, severity, and user pain points. 
Critical bugs are fixed immediately, while minor ones are planned into 
upcoming sprints. For feature enhancements, I coordinate with the product 
owner and team to balance technical effort and business value. I use sprint
planning meetings to raise concerns and help adjust scope realistically.

---

 ❓ Have you mentored or helped a junior developer? How did you approach it?

Answer:
Yes, I mentored a junior developer in my previous team. I began by understanding 
their strengths and gaps, then helped them with code walkthroughs, best practices, 
and breaking down tasks. I encouraged them to ask questions, reviewed their PRs 
constructively, and paired with them on tricky implementations. Over time, they 
became more confident and independent.

---

 ❓ Tell me about a time you missed a deadline. What happened, and what did you learn?

Answer:
In one sprint, I underestimated the complexity of integrating a third-party API.
Unexpected API response issues caused delays. I communicated the risk early, and 
while the team helped mitigate the delay, the delivery was a day late. I learned 
the importance of spike stories for unknowns and buffer time in estimations. 
Since then, I’ve been more careful in assessing risks during planning.

---

 ❓ What steps do you take to improve your skills and stay up to date with Java or Spring Boot?

Answer:
I regularly follow blogs like Baeldung, DZone, and Java news on Medium. 
I take online courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera, especially 
when new Spring Boot versions or tools like Docker/Kubernetes are updated. 
I also build small side projects to try out new concepts like reactive 
programming, and I review open-source code on GitHub to learn industry 
best practices.

Here are interview-ready answers tailored to your HSBC insurance middleware project involving Java backend, file processing, life quotation APIs, and Kafka-based microservices:

---

 ❓ 1. Can you explain how you break down a monolith into microservices?

✅ Answer:

In our project, we started with a semi-monolithic structure and gradually broke it into domain-driven microservices:

 Step 1: Identify domains – e.g., Life Quotation, File Handler, Audit Logger, Notification.
 Step 2: Decouple functionality – each service handles its own logic and database.
 Step 3: Create APIs and Events – RESTful APIs and Kafka topics were introduced for inter-service communication.
 Step 4: Deploy independently – Each service is packaged as a Docker image and deployed via Kubernetes.

---

 ❓ 2. How do you ensure communication between microservices is reliable?

✅ Answer:

We use:

 Synchronous REST calls with retry & timeout for critical flows (e.g., Quotation validation).
 Asynchronous communication using Kafka for large file operations and audit logging.

To ensure reliability:

 Kafka handles retries and durability via consumer offset tracking.
 We implement idempotency in consumers to avoid duplicates.
 Use fallback logic or error queues for failed communication.

---

 ❓ 3. How do you handle service failures in a microservice environment?

✅ Answer:

We use a combination of:

 Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j) – to stop repeated failures and fallback gracefully.
 Retry & Timeout – configured on external API calls.
 Dead Letter Topics in Kafka – to handle failed message consumption.
 Monitoring alerts – via Prometheus + Grafana to catch service failures early.

Example: If CPF service is down, we retry file transfer and alert the ops team via Slack/Email.

---

 ❓ 4. How do you manage configuration across different services and environments?

✅ Answer:

We use Spring Cloud Config with a Git-backed repository:

 Each microservice pulls config based on the profile (e.g., `application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`).
 Sensitive values (like DB passwords, tokens) are stored in Kubernetes Secrets.
 We can refresh config without restarting services using the `/actuator/refresh` endpoint.

---

 ❓ 5. How do you monitor and debug issues across microservices in production?

✅ Answer:

We use a centralized observability stack:

 Logs – aggregated via ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
 Metrics – exposed via Prometheus, visualized in Grafana dashboards.
 Tracing – using Spring Sleuth + Zipkin, to trace requests across services.
 Alerts – set on metrics like response time, error rate, Kafka lag.

If an issue arises (e.g., file not reaching CPF), we trace from the File Handler → Kafka → Audit log using correlation IDs.

---

 ❓ 6. Have you implemented Circuit Breaker, Retry, or Timeout mechanisms? Explain why.

✅ Answer:

Yes. We use Resilience4j for:

 Circuit Breaker – e.g., if the CPF directory is down, the breaker trips and prevents further calls.
 Retry – to automatically retry failed external API or file processing attempts (e.g., temporary network issues).
 Timeout – to avoid blocking threads on slow dependencies (e.g., quotation lookup timeout after 5 seconds).

This improves reliability and responsiveness of the system.

---

 ❓ 7. How do you handle database consistency in microservices with different data stores?

✅ Answer (revised):

Each microservice manages its own DB schema (e.g., QuotationDB, FileAuditDB). For consistency:

 We use event-driven communication via Kafka.
 Services listen to events (e.g., "FileProcessed", "QuotationUpdated") and update their local DB accordingly.
 SAGA pattern is used for orchestrating long-running workflows like file validation + dispatch + audit.
 Failures are handled via retries and DLQs.

This provides eventual consistency without tight coupling.

---

 ❓ 8. Can you walk me through your CI/CD process and your involvement in it?

✅ Answer:

Our CI/CD is based on Jenkins + Docker + Kubernetes:

 Build Phase:

   Jenkins triggers on Git commits.
   Runs tests (JUnit), static analysis (SonarQube).
 Packaging:

   Build Docker images and push to Nexus.
 Deploy:

   Helm charts deploy services to different environments (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod).
   Smoke tests run post-deploy.

My Role:

 I create and maintain Jenkinsfiles.
 I verify Helm templates and Dockerfiles.
 I test config across multiple environments.

---

 ❓ 9. Have you participated in production deployments? How did you ensure it went smoothly?

✅ Answer:

Yes, I’ve been part of several production releases. To ensure smooth deployment:

 Dry runs in UAT with the same config and infra.
 Verified preconditions: Kafka health, directory permissions, DB migrations.
 Enabled feature flags to disable new risky features temporarily.
 Monitored logs and metrics post-deployment to validate success.

---

 ❓ 10. What are some security concerns you handle in microservices (e.g., authentication, authorization)?

✅ Answer:

Security is critical in our insurance middleware. We handle it at multiple levels:

 Authentication:

   Implemented OAuth2 with JWT for internal service communication.
   External partners use signed tokens or basic auth.

 Authorization:

   Role-based access with Spring Security annotations.
   Only authorized agents can access customer quotations.

 Data Security:

   File payloads are encrypted (SHA-256 + Base64).
   Checksum validation ensures file integrity.
   Sensitive configs managed with Kubernetes Secrets.

 Audit Logs:

   All sensitive operations are logged and tracked.
