Here’s a selection of Spring Boot interview questions and answers for a 3-year experienced developer:

---

 1. What is Spring Boot, and how is it different from the traditional Spring Framework?

Answer:
Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the development of Spring applications by eliminating boilerplate configurations. It provides:

 Auto-configuration to set up Spring components based on dependencies.
 Embedded servers like Tomcat, so you don’t need to deploy WAR files.
 Starter dependencies for easy integration of required libraries.
  Unlike the traditional Spring Framework, where explicit XML or Java-based configuration is needed, Spring Boot reduces setup time by leveraging conventions and default configurations.

---

 2. Explain the concept of auto-configuration in Spring Boot. How does it work?

Answer:
Auto-configuration in Spring Boot is a mechanism that automatically configures your application based on the dependencies present on the classpath.

 It uses the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation, which scans the classpath for specific libraries and configures beans accordingly.
 Auto-configuration classes are defined in `META-INF/spring.factories`.
  Example: If `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` is on the classpath, Spring Boot auto-configures a `DataSource`, `EntityManager`, and `TransactionManager`.

---

 3. What is the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation?

Answer:
`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that combines:

1. `@Configuration`: Indicates the class contains Spring configuration.
2. `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism.
3. `@ComponentScan`: Scans the base package for components, services, and configurations.

Example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

---

 4. How do you configure properties in Spring Boot?

Answer:
You configure properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`. For example:

`application.properties`:

```properties
server.port=8081
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=secret
```

`application.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8081
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
    username: root
    password: secret
```

These properties can be accessed in your application using the `@Value` annotation or `@ConfigurationProperties`.

---

 5. What are Spring Profiles? How do you use them?

Answer:
Spring Profiles allow you to define different configurations for different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).

Steps to use profiles:

1. Define properties in profile-specific files like `application-dev.properties` or `application-prod.yml`.
2. Activate a profile using `spring.profiles.active`.

Example:

```properties
 application-dev.properties
server.port=8080

 application-prod.properties
server.port=80
```

To activate a profile:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

---

 6. How do you create a RESTful API in Spring Boot?

Answer:
To create a RESTful API:

1. Use `@RestController` for the controller class.
2. Define endpoints using `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

Example:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class UserController {
    
    @GetMapping("/users")
    public List<String> getUsers() {
        return Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
    }

    @PostMapping("/users")
    public String addUser(@RequestBody String user) {
        return "User " + user + " added!";
    }
}
```

---

 7. What is Spring Data JPA, and how does it simplify database operations?

Answer:
Spring Data JPA is a module of Spring that provides an abstraction over JPA. It simplifies database operations by eliminating boilerplate code.

For example:

 No need to write DAO classes.
 Predefined methods like `findAll`, `save`, `deleteById` are available.
 Custom queries can be defined using method names or `@Query`.

Repository example:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    List<User> findByName(String name);
}
```

---

 8. How do you handle exceptions in a Spring Boot REST API?

Answer:
Use `@ControllerAdvice` with `@ExceptionHandler` to handle exceptions globally.

Example:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(UserNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleUserNotFound(UserNotFoundException ex) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(ex.getMessage(), HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleGenericException(Exception ex) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>("An error occurred", HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

---

 9. What is Spring Boot Actuator?

Answer:
Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features like monitoring, metrics, and health checks.

Common endpoints:

 `/actuator/health`: Application health status.
 `/actuator/metrics`: Application metrics.
 `/actuator/env`: Environment properties.

To enable Actuator:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=
```

---

 10. How do you test a Spring Boot application?

Answer:

 Use `@SpringBootTest` for integration tests.
 Use `@WebMvcTest` for testing controllers.
 Mock dependencies using `@MockBean`.

Example:

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class UserServiceTest {

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @Test
    public void testGetUser() {
        String user = userService.getUser(1L);
        assertEquals("Alice", user);
    }
}
```

Here are answers to more Spring Boot interview questions for further preparation:

---

 11. What are starter dependencies in Spring Boot? Can you name a few commonly used ones?

Answer:
Starter dependencies are a set of pre-configured dependencies that simplify adding required libraries to a project.

Example:
Adding `spring-boot-starter-web` includes libraries like Spring MVC, embedded Tomcat, and Jackson for REST APIs.

Common starters:

 `spring-boot-starter-web`: For building web applications.
 `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: For JPA and Hibernate integration.
 `spring-boot-starter-security`: For Spring Security.
 `spring-boot-starter-test`: For testing (JUnit, Mockito).
 `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`: For Thymeleaf templates.

---

 12. Explain the purpose of `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations.

Answer:

 `@Configuration`: Marks a class as a source of Spring bean definitions.
 `@Bean`: Indicates that a method returns a bean to be managed by the Spring container.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}
```

Here, `RestTemplate` will be registered as a Spring Bean.

---

 13. What is the difference between `CrudRepository` and `JpaRepository`?

Answer:

 `CrudRepository`: Provides basic CRUD operations (`save`, `findById`, `deleteById`).
 `JpaRepository`: Extends `CrudRepository` and adds more features, such as:

   Batch operations (`saveAll`).
   Pagination and sorting support.

Example:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    List<User> findByName(String name);
}
```

---

 14. How do you implement authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application?

Answer:
Use Spring Security to implement authentication and authorization:

1. Add `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency.
2. Configure security rules in `SecurityConfig`:

Example:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user").password("{noop}password").roles("USER")
            .and()
            .withUser("admin").password("{noop}admin").roles("ADMIN");
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/admin/").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/user/").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN")
            .and()
            .formLogin();
    }
}
```

---

 15. What is the purpose of `@Transactional` annotation?

Answer:
`@Transactional` manages transactions declaratively. It ensures:

1. Atomicity: If a method fails, all changes made during the transaction are rolled back.
2. Read-only: Prevents write operations for read-only transactions.

Example:

```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class UserService {
    
    public void createUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

---

 16. What is the difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller`?

Answer:

 `@RestController`: Combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. Methods return data directly in JSON or XML format.
 `@Controller`: Used for building web applications with view templates (e.g., Thymeleaf). Methods return view names.

Example:

```java
@RestController
public class MyRestController {
    @GetMapping("/api")
    public String getData() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

---

 17. How do you use caching in Spring Boot? Explain `@Cacheable`.

Answer:
Spring Boot provides caching support via annotations like `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, and `@CacheEvict`.

Steps to enable caching:

1. Add `spring-boot-starter-cache` dependency.
2. Annotate the main class with `@EnableCaching`.
3. Use `@Cacheable` to cache method results.

Example:

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Cacheable("users")
    public User getUserById(Long id) {
        System.out.println("Fetching user from database...");
        return userRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }
}
```

The result of `getUserById` is cached, and subsequent calls with the same ID will fetch data from the cache.

---

 18. How does Spring Boot handle asynchronous processing?

Answer:
Spring Boot handles asynchronous processing using the `@Async` annotation.

Steps to enable asynchronous methods:

1. Add `@EnableAsync` to the configuration class.
2. Annotate methods with `@Async`.

Example:

```java
@EnableAsync
@Configuration
public class AsyncConfig {}

@Service
public class NotificationService {

    @Async
    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending notification: " + message);
    }
}
```

When `sendNotification` is called, it runs in a separate thread.

---

 19. What is the purpose of the `WebClient` in Spring WebFlux? How does it differ from `RestTemplate`?

Answer:

 `WebClient`: A non-blocking, reactive client for HTTP requests.
 `RestTemplate`: A blocking client for synchronous HTTP requests.

Example with `WebClient`:

```java
WebClient webClient = WebClient.create();
String response = webClient.get()
    .uri("http://example.com/api")
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(String.class)
    .block();
```

Use `WebClient` for reactive programming, especially when working with WebFlux.

---

 20. How do you monitor and tune the performance of a Spring Boot application?

Answer:

 Monitoring Tools:

   Use Spring Boot Actuator for built-in endpoints like `/actuator/metrics`.
   Integrate tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
   Use APM tools like New Relic or Dynatrace.

 Tuning Techniques:

   Optimize database queries (e.g., use indexes, limit joins).
   Configure thread pools for async tasks.
   Use caching to reduce repetitive computations.
   Tune JVM options based on profiling results.
